# GigFlux Web (Next.js + shadcn/ui)

## Goals
Fast, accessible UI with “layout intelligence”. Keyboard-first navigation.

## Tech
- Next.js (App Router), shadcn/ui + Radix, Tailwind
- TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod
- Playwright (E2E), Testing Library (unit)

## Conventions
- Use shadcn components for dialogs, menus, and forms.
- Validate forms with Zod; display inline errors.
- Keep a11y: roles, labels, focus management, ESC to close.
